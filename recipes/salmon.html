<h2>This is a classic salmon recipe that is sure to leave you and
    your guests very satisfied and in good graces with the big man upstairs. </h2>

<p>You take fresh alaskan salmon and leave it raw. Like actually do not do anything to it.
    Salt water fish are fit for human consumption raw and it is better to eat food the way god
    intended. if you have issues with this take it up with God.

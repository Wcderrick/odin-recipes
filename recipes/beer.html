<p><h2>Cooking instructions</h2></p>
<p><ol>
    <li>Look... you could really embark on a long and arduous journey to make your own shitty beer. 
        Orrr, you could go down to the local gas station and get yourself a 30 rack, invite some buddies over and have a grand ole time watching the 
        game or shooting the shit. So, go buy some nice light beer, gotta watch that figure!
    </li>
    <li>Once you have the beer, at least 144 oz for each person present, start drinking that shit, FAST!</li>
    <li>Check and see if your wife or girlfriend will bring you snacks, but do not invite her to stay and hangout. </li>
    <li>once you get nice and toasted, order some pizza or once again ask your SO to bring you food, you cant do it... you have beer to drink</li>
    <li>At the conclusion of festivities you should be hella drunk. Bid farewell to your boys and do not let them drive if they are super drunk. </li>
    <li>If they are only kinda drunk let em risk it. They are trying to go have disappointing sex with their SO's.</li>
    <li>Speaking of disappointing sex with your SO, Now is the perfect time to engage in some consensual intercourse to thank your SO for their help today</li>
    <li>Do you best to stay aroused for the act and if you can maintain an erection, Remember... faster is better. </li>
   
</ol>
